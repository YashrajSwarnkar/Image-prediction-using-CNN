# INFO7390-Prediction_of_Image_using_CNN
Required libraries:
1. Keras
2. ZipFile
3. Numpy
4. Pandas
5. Sklearn

# Project Workflow

- Import the required Python libaries at one place
- Read the train and test data set
- Display images from test and train dataset.
- Create CNN models. 
- Evaluate the model based on accuracy of training set and accuracy of validation set.
- Hyper Parameters Tuning for the model for params:
    1.  Changed Activation function in base model. 
    2.  Changed Cost function in base model.
    3.  Changed no. of epochs in base model.
    4.  Changed optimizer in base model.
    5.  Changed no. of convolution layers in base model.
    6.  Changed initilization parameter in base model.
- Predict the class of image using different model.
